            The Transgender Violence Mapping Project [TVMP] provides publicly accessible data as a reference for journalists, legislators, researchers, law enforcement, advocates, and anyone else who wants to learn more about the violence committed against transgender people. The project is ultimately centered around a publicly downloadable data source (spreadsheet) that contains a breadth of information about individual incidents. Data is collected by volunteers at data-search events. The information that is contained in the data-set includes: demographic information, location of incident, police response, media response, and the data sources. It is the goal of the TVMP to arm citizens with the truth in order to demand accountability when it comes to the injustices perpetrated against transgender victims by the police and the media.
          </p>
          <p>
          Another main element of the TVMP is the online presence, an interactive portal to explore the data using visualizations, maps, and charts. This website is currently under development. The website will developed on an open source, contributed to by volunteers. The site will also be a place where transgender writers, sociologists, data scientists, etc will publish analyses of the data.
          </p>
          <p>
          This project is currently under development by one dedicated advocate, a transgender woman and student in San Francisco, CA. One public event for the TVMP took place in June 2015 at the Mozilla headquarters. Many admirable volunteers came out to commemorate the lives of murdered trans women of color and work with their local trans community. Having more public events and open hack sessions in the Bay Area and beyond is a great way to expand the potential pool of sources contributing to the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donations are appreciated in supporting the Transgender Violence Mapping Project. And if you're located in the Bay Area and would like to give in a way other than money, please contact me at jeanieotter@gmail.com. Donations will be used to: provide food and venues for events, support web development team, pay for online services associated with running a web site, pay trans writers to contribute.
